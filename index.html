            <ol>
                <li><p><strong>Game Board:</strong> The game board consists of a grid of squares. Each square may contain a mine or be empty.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Mines:</strong> mines are hidden within the grid squares. The number of mines and the size of the board can vary depending on the difficulty level chosen by the player.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Opening Squares:</strong> The game begins with the player selecting a square on the grid to open. If the selected square contains a mine, the game is over, and the mine detonates. If the square is empty, the game continues, and the square reveals a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it (including diagonals).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Numbers:</strong> Each number revealed on the board represents the count of mines adjacent to that square. For example, if a square reveals the number "3," it means that there are three mines in the eight squares surrounding it.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Empty Squares:</strong> If a square is revealed to be empty (i.e., it has no adjacent mines), it automatically opens all adjacent empty squares.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Flagging Mines:</strong> Players can mark squares they suspect contain mines by flagging them. This helps to keep track of where the mines might be.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong><u>Winning:</u></strong> The player wins the game when all non-mine squares are opened. This means that all mines have been correctly flagged, and all non-mine squares have been revealed.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong><u>Losing:</u></strong> The player loses the game if they reveal a square containing a mine. In this case, all mines on the board are typically revealed, and the game ends.</p></li>
